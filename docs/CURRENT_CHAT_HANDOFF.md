# Current Chat Handoff

## Active track

Policy Onboarding OCR hardening is the immediate active work. Production portal is `https://portal.insureit.in`. Ordinary commits do not intentionally deploy production; `.deploy/production-trigger.json` is changed only after the user explicitly says `deploy now` or `finish and deploy`.

## Verified pre-change parser baseline

User-local baseline before the latest structured-table architecture work:

```text
IFFCO regression:    10/10 passed
Digit regression:     5/5 passed
New India regression: 5/5 passed
Typecheck:             passed
Lint:                  0 errors
Build:                 passed
```

Do not reuse this as proof that the new structured-table commits pass.

## Live production findings

Repeated live tests with IFFCO policy `N8109328` established:

- insurer detection fixed: IFFCO-TOKIO
- product fixed: Package
- policy number fixed
- IDV fixed
- valid from/upto fixed and apply correctly
- CPA later read correctly as 330
- flattened OCR premium interpretation remained unsafe, producing OD `1` and TP values such as `997134`/`22409`

Durable learning: flattened table reading order must not be used as the sole financial evidence.

Known correct accounting target:

```text
Basic TP 7267 + Legal Liability 100 = TP 7367
CPA = 330
Printed net = 22739
OD = 22739 - 7367 - 330 = 15042
```

## Current implementation

**IMPLEMENTED / NOT YET DEPLOYED OR VERIFIED:** a second IFFCO financial pass now consumes Google Document AI table cell anchors (`pages[].tables[]`) instead of relying only on flattened page text.

New file:

```text
apps/web-portal/lib/policy-ocr-iffco-structured-refiner.ts
```

Server action now extracts structured table rows and runs the structured IFFCO refiner after the existing text refiner. The structured pass rebuilds OD/TP/CPA from labeled premium rows and only returns them when the complete financial equation reconciles to printed net. If evidence is incomplete, financial fields are withheld rather than guessed.

Regression added:

```text
npm run policy-ocr:iffco-structured-regression
```

It covers the exact production-shaped bad state and the fail-safe missing-CPA case.

```

## Immediate next step

Before any deployment, user/local environment should run:

```text
npm run policy-ocr:iffco-structured-regression
npm run policy-ocr:iffco-regression
npm run policy-ocr:digit-regression
npm run policy-ocr:new-india-regression
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```

If these pass, wait for explicit deployment approval. After deployment, upload the same IFFCO file and verify OD `15042`, TP `7367`, CPA `330`. If Google returns no usable structured table rows, preserve Review Required and inspect sanitized structural evidence; do not add another proximity-based numeric guess.

United India remains deferred.
